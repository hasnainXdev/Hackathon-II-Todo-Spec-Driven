# Create event driven todo system spec

## Original Prompt

```
TaskFlow — an event-driven Todo Chatbot system built to demonstrate real-world distributed systems using Kafka, Kubernetes, and Dapr. 2. Problem Statement Traditional Todo applications are tightly coupled CRUD systems where: Features like reminders and recurring tasks block request flows Scaling background jobs is fragile Activity history is incomplete or inaccurate Multi-client sync is hard to reason about This project solves that by building a fully event-driven Todo system where: The core app publishes events Specialized services react asynchronously Infrastructure reflects production-grade patterns 3. What Is Being Built (High-Level) A Todo Chatbot Platform consisting of: A Chat-driven Todo API Multiple backend services communicating via Kafka Kubernetes-based deployment (local + cloud) Event-driven execution for reminders, recurring tasks, audit logs, and real-time updates Spec-driven, agent-generated implementation (no manual coding) The UI is intentionally minimal. The system's value is architectural, not visual. 4. System Capabilities (User-Facing) The system allows a user to: 4.1 Task Management Create tasks Update tasks Delete tasks Mark tasks as complete Each task supports: Title Description Priority Tags Due date Optional recurrence rule 4.2 Advanced Task Features Due Dates & Reminders Tasks may include due dates Reminder events are generated asynchronously Reminder handling is decoupled from task creation Recurring Tasks Tasks can repeat (e.g., daily, weekly) Completing a task triggers creation of the next occurrence Recurrence logic runs outside the core API Search, Filter, Sort Tasks can be searched Tasks can be filtered by priority, tags, completion state Tasks can be sorted by date or priority 4.3 Chat-Based Interaction Users interact with the system via a Chat API Chat commands map to task operations The Chat API is the event producer, not the business processor 5. System Capabilities (Non-User-Facing) 5.1 Event-Driven Execution Every significant task operation emits an event: Task created Task updated Task completed Task deleted Events are first-class citizens in the system. 5.2 Asynchronous Background Processing The system includes backend services that: Consume Kafka topics Perform their work independently Never block user requests 5.3 Activity & Audit Tracking Every task operation is captured as an immutable event A complete audit trail can be reconstructed from Kafka consumers 5.4 Real-Time Synchronization Task changes propagate asynchronously Multiple clients observe updates consistently 6. Services Being Built (Conceptual, Not Technical) This phase builds multiple logical services, including: Chat API Service Handles user input and task CRUD, publishes events Recurring Task Service Listens for completion events and spawns new tasks Notification Service Processes reminder-related events Audit Service Consumes task events and stores activity history WebSocket / Sync Service Broadcasts task updates to connected clients Each service is independent, event-driven, and replaceable. 7. Data Ownership Model The core task data is stored in a primary database Kafka is the source of truth for behavior, not storage Services do not share databases directly State required for processing may be cached or derived 8. Deployment Environments (What Exists) The system must run in: Local Kubernetes Minikube Used for development and verification Cloud Kubernetes One production-grade cluster (AKS, GKE, or Oracle OKE) Demonstrates real deployment, not a mock The same logical system runs in both environments. 9. Observability (What Is Visible) The system exposes: Structured application logs Clear produce/consume Kafka logs Kubernetes-level visibility via kubectl logs No advanced observability stack is required. 10. Constraints (Hard Rules) No manual coding All code generated by AI agents Kafka is mandatory and real Dapr is used only for state and secrets UI completeness is not required Architecture depth is required 11. Out of Scope (Explicitly Not Built) To avoid scope creep, the following are out of scope: Authentication / authorization Mobile applications Payments or monetization Enterprise role management Full UI polish 12. Success Criteria (Definition of "Done") The system is considered complete when: A task can be created and emits a Kafka event Completing a recurring task spawns the next task asynchronously Reminders are handled via background services An audit log reflects all task activity The system runs on Minikube and one cloud cluster Judges can verify behavior via logs in under 5 minutes 13. Why This System Exists This project exists to prove: We understand how to design, build, and deploy real event-driven systems in cloud-native environments using Kafka and Kubernetes. Everything else is secondary.
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the event-driven Todo Chatbot system. The specification includes:

- User scenarios and testing with prioritized user stories
- Functional requirements covering all system capabilities
- Key entities involved in the system
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes

The spec follows the template structure and avoids implementation details, focusing on user value and business needs. A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification.

## Outcome

Successfully created the feature specification at specs/001-event-driven-todo/spec.md with all required sections completed. The specification is ready for the planning phase.

## Evaluation

The specification captures all the essential elements of the event-driven Todo Chatbot system, including task management, recurring tasks, reminders, search/filtering, and audit trails. It emphasizes the event-driven architecture with Kafka and Kubernetes as required. The success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
