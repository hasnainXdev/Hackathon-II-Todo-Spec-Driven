# Update Plan with Technology Stack

## Original Prompt

```
/sp.plan update plan to also include:
if you found out existing so don't replace them

before replacing use context7 mcp server to fetch latest doc on Openai Chatkit and Openai Python agents also official MCP SDK

Frontend
OpenAI ChatKit
Backend
Python FastAPI
AI Framework
OpenAI Agents SDK
MCP Server
Official MCP SDK
ORM
SQLModel
Database
Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
Authentication
Better Auth
```

## Response Summary

Successfully updated the implementation plan to include the specified technologies and incorporated the latest documentation from Context7. The following changes were made:

1. Updated the Technical Context section in plan.md with detailed information about:
   - OpenAI ChatKit for the frontend
   - Python FastAPI for the backend
   - OpenAI Agents SDK for AI processing
   - Official MCP SDK for Model Context Protocol
   - SQLModel as the ORM
   - Neon Serverless PostgreSQL as the database
   - Better Auth for authentication

2. Created comprehensive documentation:
   - research.md with findings from technology research
   - data-model.md with detailed entity models
   - quickstart.md with setup and usage instructions
   - contracts/chat-api.yaml with OpenAPI specification

3. Updated the agent context in QWEN.md with information about the new technology stack

4. Enhanced the Constitution Check section to reflect continued compliance with all principles

The plan now accurately reflects the technology stack specified in your request and incorporates the latest documentation from Context7 for each technology. The implementation approach maintains all the architectural principles while leveraging the new technologies effectively.
